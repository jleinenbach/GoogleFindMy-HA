# tests/test_options_flow_credentials_reload.py
"""The credential step must not promise a reload that cannot arrive.

Claiming the shared reload latch is a *promise to reload*, and the release
points (unload, setup, entry removal) all presuppose that a reload actually
arrives. Where it cannot -- a terminal lifecycle state, a disabled entry, an
ignored one -- the promise must not be made at all: the latch would stay set
for the life of the process and every later credential write would stand down
with its own credentials ineffective.

Deliberately a new file rather than an addition to
``tests/test_options_flow_credentials_cache.py``: that one is on the
``LEGACY_ALLOWLIST`` of ``test_guard_asyncio_run_antipattern.py`` and drives its
coroutines through ``asyncio.run``. Appending here would slip past the
file-set guard while still violating ``tests/AGENTS.md``.
