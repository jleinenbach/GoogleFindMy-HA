"""Defense-2 regression tests for the FCM supervisor short-run crash cap.

Covers PLAN_HOTFIX_FCM_CASCADING_FAILURE AP-2 (`fcm_receiver_ha.py`):
- 7 building-block tests (threshold trigger, break, reset, re-registration,

    """Lightweight ``FcmPushClient`` substitute for supervisor-loop tests.

    Mirrors only the surface the supervisor reads/writes (``start``, ``stop``,
    ``run_state``, ``do_listen``, ``_observe_counter``).

    Two clock-injection hooks model the supervisor's snapshot boundary
    correctly:

    * ``jump_on_start`` advances the clock inside ``start()`` BEFORE the
      supervisor takes the ``entry_start`` snapshot (Z. 960). It models
      pre-monitor elapsed time and does NOT influence ``run_duration``.
    * ``jump_on_run_state_read`` advances the clock on the first
      ``pc.run_state`` access INSIDE the monitor loop (Z. 964), which is
      AFTER the ``entry_start`` snapshot. It is the only correct way to
      inject elapsed-run time that ``run_duration = time.monotonic() -
      entry_start`` actually observes. Use this for boundary math.

    Iter-11 ``become_started``: defaults to ``True`` so the first
    ``run_state`` read returns ``FcmPushClientRunState.STARTED`` (setting
    the supervisor's per-run ``became_started`` latch) and the second
    read returns ``None`` (forcing the ``state is None`` break path on
    the next iteration with ``last_activity is None``). This mirrors the
    poison-message scenario the cap is designed to catch: client
    connects, decodes, dies, repeat. Set ``become_started=False`` to
    model a pre-start failure (MCS unreachable / login failed) where the
    client NEVER reaches ``STARTED`` and the cap MUST NOT advance the
    counter.

# CI follow-up (PR #1086 iter-13): Class-Identity substitution defense
#
# Iter-12 added _ObservableFcmPushClient as a subclass of FcmPushClient. The
# production factory must construct that subclass. Tests, however, may
# substitute the module-level FcmPushClient symbol via monkeypatch (the
# documented seam) to inject test doubles -- e.g. test_receiver_reuses_
# hass_managed_session in tests/test_fcm_receiver_guard.py asserts
# ``isinstance(created, DummyPushClient)``. A factory that always returns
# the production subclass would break isinstance identity against the
# patched symbol because the subclass inherits from the ORIGINAL class,
# not from the patched one. The factory therefore checks at CALL TIME
# whether the module symbol still points at the snapshot of the original
# class, and instantiates the patched class directly when not.
# (CA-SUBCLASS-IDENTITY-001)
