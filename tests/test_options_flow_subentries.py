        ``subentry_type`` is a parameter rather than a constant because the

        subentry whose ``group_key`` drifted from its type -- the alias case
        ``agents/config_flow/AGENTS.md`` describes under
        ``Subentry alias handling``.

        ``None`` is admitted for the same reason the type is a parameter at
        all: an untyped legacy subentry is a distinct shape from every named
        type, and it is the one that separates "prefers a ``tracker``-typed

    ``('schema', '_schema', 'msg', 'description', '__hash__')`` and carries no
    ``__dict__``, so ``vol.Marker('x').default`` raises ``AttributeError``.
    Only ``Optional.__init__`` and ``Required.__init__`` assign it. Hence the
    generic ``getattr`` rather than either subclass: a missing attribute means
    the key is not a default-carrying marker at all (a bare ``str`` key, say),
    which is a different fault from a marker whose default is the ``UNDEFINED``
    sentinel, and the two are reported apart. Every stored default is a
    factory, hence the call; ``default=None`` yields a factory returning
    ``None``, never a bare ``None``, so the two guards never collide.

    Scope of the pin: this reads ``default``, and in a real Home Assistant
    form a ``suggested_value`` in the marker's ``description`` outranks it.
    ``FlowHandler.add_suggested_values_to_schema`` sets that key on every
    ``vol.Marker`` whose name it finds in the suggested mapping (measured
    against core 2026.2.3,
    which is what binds under this suite -- the conftest double is the
    fallback for a missing core, not what runs here). Neither field this pins
    is an options key, so neither reaches that mapping today; the day one does,

    """The ground every other test in this file stands on.

    Home Assistant exposes ``ConfigEntry.subentries`` as a ``MappingProxyType``,
    not as a ``dict``. That distinction is not cosmetic here: production reaches
    the subentries through an ``isinstance`` guard, and a guard narrowed to
    ``dict`` passes every test in this file while skipping every subentry a real
    user has. It did exactly that from 2025-10-27 until this commit, which is
    why the check runs against a genuine ``ConfigEntry`` rather than against the
    local stub -- a stub asserted against itself could only ever confirm its own
    shape.

    The identity assertion is the load-bearing one, and two of the assertions
    below are deliberately *not*: when the guard skips everything,
    ``_gather_subentry_options`` appends a synthetic option that carries
    ``TRACKER_SUBENTRY_KEY`` and is likewise exactly one, so neither
    ``option.key`` nor ``len(options)`` can tell the two paths apart. They are
    kept as context, not as evidence. What separates the paths is that the
    synthetic option has no backing subentry, so ``subentry_id`` is the cell
    that has to be checked, and the label -- the subentry's title rather than
    the entry's -- is checked next to it because it is what the user reads.
    Measured rather than reasoned: with the guard narrowed back to ``dict``,
    this test fails on the ``subentry_id`` line, not before it.

    Reaching the genuine class takes a detour that is worth naming, because it
    is the second reason the suite was blind here. ``tests/conftest.py`` puts a
    synthetic ``homeassistant.config_entries`` into ``sys.modules``, so the
    ``from homeassistant.config_entries import ...`` form at the top of this
    file resolves to the stub -- whose ``ConfigEntry`` is a bare placeholder
    without subentries. The parent package still carries the real submodule as
    an attribute, so the ``import ... as`` form below reaches it (measured: the
    two disagree, one reports the installed file, the other reports no file).
    Both imports are function-local as a consequence, which incidentally keeps
    the rest of this file independent of an optional plugin.

    Measured rather than assumed: extending the *first* loop with the same
    type axis -- the literal shape the plan proposed -- turns that pin red
    (``'owner@example.com'`` where it demands ``'service'``) and takes
    ``::test_the_preselected_group_survives_the_collision_rewrite`` with it,
    because nothing is parked there and the branch has no work to do. The axis
    belongs inside the parked case, not in front of it.

    ``no-typed-tracker`` is not decoration: it exercises the fallback, which
    keeps the older guarantee that the preselection accepts devices even where
    no candidate carries the tracker type at all. Without it the type
    preference would read as a requirement.

    """The preselection is pinned where the user meets it: in the form.

    Five tests above call ``_default_subentry_key`` directly, and that is the
    narrower question. A step can compute the right key and still render a
    different one -- pass ``next(iter(choices))`` into the marker, drop the
    argument, rebuild the schema after the call -- and every helper-level test
    stays green while the form a user opens preselects the wrong group. All
    three of those mutations were run against this test and all three turned
    it red, the rebuild included: ``add_suggested_values_to_schema`` binds to
    the real core here and preserves the marker's default through its
    ``copy.copy``, so a rebuild that drops it is visible. The
    submit path makes that costly rather than cosmetic: ``repairs_move`` writes
    the chosen devices to whatever the target field holds when the user submits
    without touching it.

    Two steps rather than one because they reach the helper through different
    choice maps, and ``service_is_offered`` pins that difference instead of
    assuming it: ``settings`` passes the unfiltered ``_subentry_choice_map``
    and legitimately offers the service group, ``repairs_move`` passes
    ``_device_target_choice_map``, whose filter removes it. A fixture that only
    exercised one of the two would leave the other step's wiring unpinned.

    The shape is deliberately the *first* loop of the helper -- a
    tracker-keyed group that accepts devices, sorting last by label -- and not
    the parked branch: the parked branch is unreachable from ``repairs_move``
    by construction, because "parked" means "refuses devices" and that is
    exactly the filter standing in front of it. Picking the parked shape here
    would have pinned nothing on that half, which the first draft of this test
    did before it was measured.

    ``rendered != first_offered`` is what makes this test about the wiring
    rather than about the fixture: label order hands back ``Alpha`` in both
    steps, so a step that stopped passing the helper's answer along would show
    ``Alpha`` and fail here while every helper-level test stayed green.
