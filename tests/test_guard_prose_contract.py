# tests/test_guard_prose_contract.py
"""Guard for the two prose rules of the repository contract.

``AGENTS.md`` states two rules about the prose a contributor writes, and until now
neither had a mechanism behind it:

* **English-only prose.** The "Language reminder" and "Language policy" paragraphs of
  ``AGENTS.md`` require inline comments, docstrings and documentation to stay English.
  Translation payloads are explicitly exempt ("Translation files remain multilingual").
  Referenced by their headings rather than by line number: this branch shifts those
  lines itself, and a line number in prose is exactly the kind of claim this guard
  otherwise asks people to ground.
* **Verifiable evidence.** ``AGENTS.md`` section "2. Mandatory evidence" requires every
  claim to cite a source *inside the project reality*. A pointer into an agent's private
  memory tree is unreachable for every human reader and is therefore not such a source.

Both are plain text rules with no linter behind them, so violations pass ``ruff``,
``mypy``, ``codespell`` and the whole test suite silently and only surface in review.
That is the gap ``test_guard_path_header`` was written for, and this guard follows its
shape: a sweep, a ``LEGACY_ALLOWLIST`` with a measured reason per entry, and a stale
test that goes red once an entry stops violating.

Why one file for two rules: both arms need the same prose extraction, which is the
non-trivial part. Two files would mean two copies of ``_prose_units`` and guaranteed
drift; the regexes are the cheap half.

Why extraction instead of a raw grep over the file: foreign-language text is legitimate
*data* here. ``tests/test_translation_placeholders.py`` asserts against the German
address form, and ``translations/*.json`` is multilingual by contract. Only separating
prose from literals makes the rule machine-checkable at all. Measured over the 503
Python sources of the sweep set, this file excluded (see the counting unit further
down): the prose arm flags 12 of 29992 prose units, while the same word list over raw text additionally hits 11 occurrences in three further
files (``map_i18n.py``, ``test_map_i18n.py``, ``test_map_view_blocking_io.py``), every
one of them translation data in a string literal.

Scope of the language arm: Python prose across the whole repository, not narrowed to
``tests/**`` like the path-header guard. That narrowing exists there because
``custom_components/**`` carries pre-existing offenders; here it carries zero
(measured), so there is no retrofit debate to avoid.

Scope of the evidence arm: Python prose plus Markdown and workflow files, because a
source is cited in documentation at least as often as in code. Measured over 553 files
(503 Python sources including type stubs, 50 Markdown and workflow): zero hits.

Markdown is deliberately **out** of scope for the language arm, although the contract
covers "documentation updates" too. ``AGENTS.md`` itself quotes the German Home
Assistant translation guideline and would need an allowlist entry from day one, which
is the shape that erodes. The gap is named here rather than left for a reader to
discover.

Detection limits, stated rather than implied. The language arm keys on German function
words that have no English homograph, so German prose built only from words outside
that set passes. That is deliberate. The wider variants were measured and rejected: an
umlaut character class flags the proper name in every copyright header and misses
umlaut-free German entirely, and a two-distinct-words threshold only passed its positive
control because the three nouns of one concrete incident had been added to the list. A
guard that cries wolf gets switched off rather than obeyed, as ``tests/AGENTS.md`` puts
it, so the arm is tuned for precision and says so.

A second note, on `codespell`: the word list below trips it ten times, because German
function words look like English typos to a dictionary checker. That is the same state
``tests/test_translation_placeholders.py`` has lived in for a long time (16 hits), and it
is left as is on purpose. The CI job is non-blocking (``continue-on-error: true``), but
the pre-commit hook is not, so a local ``pre-commit run`` flags this file exactly as it
flags its sibling. Widening ``[tool.codespell] ignore-words-list`` would hide the
real English typos that several of those words shadow, across the whole tree, which is a
worse trade than ten lines in a report the CI does not gate on.

Note this paragraph cannot name those typo pairs: this guard reads its own docstring, so
writing the German half of such a pair here turns the file red. The same reflex applies
to every explanation added below.

What would make this guard obsolete: a linter with real language detection in the
pre-commit chain, or a ``ruff`` rule for prose language. Until one exists, a word list
with measured exclusions is the cheapest thing that fails loudly.

One environment note that cost a measurement: this tree uses PEP 695 syntax, which only
parses on Python 3.12 and newer. Under an older interpreter seven modules fail to parse
and the language arm would be blind to them. ``test_every_swept_file_parses`` turns that
into a red test instead of a silent gap.
