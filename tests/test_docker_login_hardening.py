# tests/test_docker_login_hardening.py
"""Regression guards for the docker-login helper hardening.

These are text guards (in the spirit of ``test_hacs_validation.py``) that lock in
security/usability fixes for the containerised login helper so they cannot silently
regress. Each guard maps to a concrete Codex review finding on PR #1208:

* Secrets file must stay owner-only ``0600`` and be handed to the host user via an
  ownership handoff, never relaxed to world-readable ``0644`` (findings A + C).
* The launchers must start the container with ``docker compose run`` (interactive,
  stdin attached) rather than ``docker compose up``, or the one-time
  ``Press Enter`` prompt blocks forever (finding B).
* noVNC must stay bound to loopback by default (earlier finding), so the
  fixed-password session is not exposed on the LAN during sign-in.
* A context-level ``.dockerignore`` must be an ALLOWLIST (ignore the whole
  build context, re-include only the two paths the Dockerfile COPYs) so that
  EVERY secret location -- ``docker-login/data`` AND the legacy
  ``Auth/secrets.json`` AND any future token/cache path -- stays out of the
  ``--build`` context, not just the one path a denylist happens to name.
* The ownership handoff must run from an ``EXIT`` trap, so a nonzero/interrupted
  ``main.py`` run still returns the produced secrets.json to the host user.
