# tests/test_docker_login_hardening.py
"""Regression guards for the docker-login helper hardening.

Most guards here are text guards (in the spirit of ``test_hacs_validation.py``)
that lock in security/usability fixes for the containerised login helper so they
cannot silently regress; the final guard
(``test_backgrounded_login_child_behaviourally_keeps_stdin_and_default_sigint``)
is a BEHAVIOURAL test that runs the real backgrounding construct from
``entrypoint.sh`` and asserts stdin/SIGINT at runtime, so the launch fix is proven
by behaviour rather than by matching script text. Each guard maps to a concrete
Codex review finding on PR #1208:

* Secrets file must stay owner-only ``0600`` and be handed to the host user via an
  ownership handoff, never relaxed to world-readable ``0644`` (findings A + C).
* The launchers must start the container with ``docker compose run`` (interactive,
  stdin attached) rather than ``docker compose up``, or the account-e-mail prompt
  blocks forever (finding B).
* noVNC must stay bound to loopback by default (earlier finding), so the
  fixed-password session is not exposed on the LAN during sign-in.
* A context-level ``.dockerignore`` must be an ALLOWLIST (ignore the whole
  build context, re-include only the two paths the Dockerfile COPYs) so that
  EVERY secret location -- ``docker-login/data`` AND the legacy
  ``Auth/secrets.json`` AND any future token/cache path -- stays out of the
  ``--build`` context, not just the one path a denylist happens to name. A bare
  ``!docker-login`` re-includes the WHOLE directory, so it is re-excluded again
  (``docker-login/*``) down to just the one re-included file
  (``!docker-login/entrypoint.sh``); a file dropped directly under
  ``docker-login/`` must NOT reach the context (Codex P2 on PR #1210).
* The QNAP "Container Station" README guidance must NOT present importing the
  compose file as an *application* (``docker compose up`` semantics, no stdin) as
  a first-login path: the ``input("Enter your Google account email:")`` prompt can
  never be answered without a terminal, so the login must go through the stdin-attaching
  ``docker compose run`` (SSH) path (Codex P2 on PR #1210).
* The ownership handoff must run from an ``EXIT`` trap, so a nonzero/interrupted
  ``main.py`` run still returns the produced secrets.json to the host user.
* The CLI must run as a BACKGROUND child that the entrypoint waits on, and the
  signal traps must FORWARD SIGTERM/SIGINT to it. A foreground child makes bash
  defer the trap until the child exits, so ``docker stop`` escalates to SIGKILL and
  the EXIT cleanup never runs (finding: forward termination signals to the child).
* Backgrounding that child must PRESERVE its terminal stdin (``<&0`` at the async
  boundary) and RESET SIGINT/SIGQUIT to default (``trap - INT QUIT`` before exec):
  a non-interactive script otherwise gives an async child ``/dev/null`` stdin (the
  ``input()`` login prompt hits EOF) and hard-ignores SIGINT (Python drops Ctrl-C),
  both regressions of the backgrounding fix above.
* Only the noVNC viewer (7900) may be published. The launchers always pass
  ``--service-ports``, so anything declared in ``docker-compose.yml`` is published
  on EVERY run; a second port entry made the container fail to start on a host
  where that port was already taken, which also broke the file handoff (``./data``)
  and the ``GFMY_CLEARTEXT=1`` output, neither of which uses a port. The token
  endpoint that once carried a second publish was removed with PR #1218, so the
  compose file declares exactly one port and no overlay exists.
* The login image installs ``setuptools`` alongside ``requirements.txt`` in its
  build step. undetected-chromedriver 3.5.5 (the current PyPI top) still imports
  the stdlib ``distutils`` that Python 3.12+ removed (PEP 632); the
  ``selenium/standalone-chrome:latest`` base image is on Python 3.14, so without
  ``setuptools`` re-providing ``distutils`` via its ``_distutils_hack`` the bare
  import fails (``ModuleNotFoundError: distutils``) and Chrome never starts.
  Dropping ``setuptools`` from the install step would restore that failure while
  every other guard here stays green (Codex P1 on PR #1215).

    silent -- a value the launcher forwards but the container warns about, or the
    reverse. This runs both over the same inputs and asserts they agree.
