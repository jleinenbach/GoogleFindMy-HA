# **Forensic Analysis of Unwanted Tracking Protocols: Trigger Mechanisms, Sensor Fusion, and False Positive Etiologies in BLE Location Networks**

## **1. Introduction: The Paradigm Shift in Crowd-Sourced Location Tracking**

The advent of crowd-sourced location networks, pioneered at scale by Tile and subsequently revolutionized by Apple’s "Find My" and Google’s "Find My Device" (FMDN) ecosystems, has fundamentally altered the landscape of asset recovery. However, the omnipresence of these secure, low-energy beacons has introduced a dual-use dilemma: the same technology that recovers lost luggage can be repurposed for illicit surveillance and stalking. In response to these privacy threats, platform holders and hardware manufacturers have engaged in an arms race of firmware updates and standardizations—culminating in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) "Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers" (DULT) specification.¹

For technical teams tasked with debugging system anomalies, specifically the phenomenon of "sporadic" or "phantom" ringing in tracking devices, a superficial understanding of these systems is insufficient. The behavior of a modern tracker is no longer a simple beaconing loop; it is a complex, deterministic state machine governed by cryptographic timers, motion-gated sensor fusion, and inter-device communication protocols. The user's query highlights a critical confusion often observed in field diagnostics: the conflation of handset-side detection algorithms (which utilize GPS) with tracker-side autonomous logic (which relies on inertial sensors).

This report provides an exhaustive, forensic-level analysis of the triggering mechanisms for Apple AirTags, Chipolo Point, Pebblebee, and other FMDN-compliant devices. It deconstructs the hardware architecture, specifically the Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) accelerometers that serve as the "eyes" of these GPS-blind devices, and rigorously evaluates the hypothesis that Global Positioning System (GPS) drift can simulate movement to trigger autonomous alerts. Furthermore, it details the precise temporal windows and logic gates that govern the transition from a "Connected" state to an "Unwanted Tracking" state, providing a robust framework for debugging false positives in deployed hardware.

## **2. Architectural Divergence: Handset-Side vs. Tracker-Side Alerts**

To successfully debug sporadic ringing, it is imperative to first decouple the two distinct alert vectors employed by modern tracking networks. These vectors operate on independent hardware stacks, utilize different sensor data, and are triggered by mutually exclusive logic trees. The confusion in user reports often stems from a failure to distinguish between an alert generated by the victim's smartphone (Vector A) and an alert generated autonomously by the tracking hardware (Vector B).

### **2.1 Vector A: The Handset-Based Alert ("Found Moving With You")**

This alert category is generated by the operating system of the device detecting the tracker—typically iOS or Android. It is a computational inference made by the smartphone based on the correlation between the phone's movement and the persistent presence of a specific Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Media Access Control (MAC) address.

The mechanism relies on a "host-centric" sensor fusion model. The smartphone utilizes its internal GPS/GNSS receiver, Wi-Fi positioning system, and cellular triangulation to establish its own geospatial velocity vector. Simultaneously, the phone's Bluetooth radio scans for advertising packets from nearby peripherals. If the operating system detects that a specific BLE identifier—specifically one broadcasting the "Separated" or "Unwanted Tracking" status bit—is maintaining a consistent Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) while the phone itself is displacing geographically, the "Unknown Tracker Detected" logic is satisfied.³

It is within this specific vector that the user's hypothesis regarding GPS drift is technically valid. If a smartphone is stationary on a bedside table but experiences significant GPS drift (e.g., multipath errors causing the location fix to wander 100–200 meters), the operating system's location services may erroneously calculate a velocity. If the tracker is sitting nearby, the phone perceives the following scenario: "I am moving (according to GPS error), and this unknown Bluetooth device is moving with me (RSSI is constant)." This results in a false positive system notification on the screen.⁵ Crucially, however, this does *not* inherently cause the tracker to ring unless the user interacts with the notification to send a "Play Sound" command.

### **2.2 Vector B: The Autonomous Tracker Alert (The "Beep")**

The second vector—and the primary focus of this report regarding "sporadic ringing" in the absence of user interaction—is the autonomous behavior of the tracker itself. This logic is embedded in the tracker's firmware (e.g., running on a Nordic Semiconductor nRF52 series SoC) and operates completely independently of any nearby smartphone.

These devices are "location-blind." Due to severe constraints on power consumption (running for a year on a CR2032 coin cell) and physical size, standard consumer trackers like the AirTag, Chipolo One Point, or Pebblebee Clip do not contain GPS receivers, cellular modems, or Wi-Fi radios.⁷ They exist in an inertial frame of reference. Their "reality" is defined solely by two inputs:

1. **Time:** The duration since the last cryptographic handshake with the bonded owner device.  
2. **Inertia:** The physical forces detected by an onboard MEMS accelerometer (e.g., Bosch BMA530).¹⁰

Therefore, for a tracker to ring *spontaneously* without a command from a phone, specific conditions regarding time (separation) and motion (accelerometer interrupt) must be met. GPS drift on a nearby phone is invisible to the tracker and cannot trigger this autonomous sound. The following sections detail the exact state machines for Apple and Google ecosystems that govern this behavior.

## **3. Apple AirTag: The "Find My" State Machine**

The Apple AirTag represents the industry benchmark for anti-stalking logic, utilizing a sophisticated proprietary implementation of the Find My protocol. The behavior of the device is not static; it has evolved significantly through firmware updates (specifically post-launch updates in 2021 and 2022) to tighten the separation windows and increase the sensitivity of motion detection. Understanding the current firmware logic is essential for debugging.

### **3.1 The Separation Timer ($T_{sep}$) logic**

The foundational trigger for any autonomous alert is the separation timer. An AirTag maintains an internal clock that tracks the time elapsed since the last successful connection to the owner's iPhone. It is critical to note that a "connection" in this context is not merely seeing the owner's Bluetooth advertisement; it requires a successful cryptographic handshake that validates the owner's identity key. This prevents spoofing attacks where a malicious actor might try to reset the timer of a stalked victim's tag.

Upon launch, the separation window was set to a static three days. However, in response to privacy concerns, Apple updated the firmware (versions 1.0.276 and later) to implement a randomized window of **8 to 24 hours**.¹¹ This randomization is a deliberate security feature. By varying the trigger time, Apple prevents stalkers from predicting exactly when a device will become audible, complicating their ability to hide or silence the device preemptively.

When the timer $T_{sep}$ expires—for example, the tag has not seen the owner for 14 hours—the device transitions from the "Monitoring" state to the "Primed" state. In the "Primed" state, the device enables its audio subsystem logic, but it remains silent. The transition to the audible "Alert" state is gated exclusively by the accelerometer.

### **3.2 The Accelerometer Gating Mechanism**

The decision to gate the audio alert behind a motion sensor is driven by two factors: battery conservation and social engineering. A lost set of keys lying motionless in a field or a cafe does not need to beep, as no one is there to hear it. Continuous beeping would drain the CR2032 battery in a matter of days. Furthermore, an anti-stalking feature is most effective when the victim is interacting with the object concealing the tracker—picking up a purse, entering a car, or putting on a coat.

Apple utilizes a high-sensitivity MEMS accelerometer to detect these events. Technical analysis of the firmware behavior indicates that the "Primed" AirTag enters a low-power sensing mode. It does not require violent shaking to trigger. The threshold is calibrated to detect:

1. **Rotation:** An orientation change of approximately **10 degrees** or more around any axis.¹³  
2. **Vibration:** Sustained vibration characteristic of vehicle movement or walking.

Once the accelerometer registers an event exceeding these thresholds while in the "Primed" state, the AirTag executes the play_sound routine. The sound emitted is a specific "Separated" chirp sequence, distinct from the "Locate" sound initiated by a user. This sound plays for approximately 5 seconds. Following the alert, the device enters a "Cooldown" state—typically monitoring for further motion every 10 seconds or pausing for a longer interval to prevent constant annoyance—before re-arming the trigger.¹⁵

### **3.3 Debugging "Unmoved" AirTag Ringing**

The user asks if ringing can occur when the tracker is "unmoved." While technically the answer is no (motion is required), the definition of "unmoved" differs between human perception and MEMS sensor reality. Debugging sporadic ringing in ostensibly stationary AirTags requires investigating three "False Motion" vectors:

* **Vector 1: Micro-Vibrations and Resonance.** The accelerometer in the AirTag is sensitive enough to detect floor vibrations. If an AirTag is placed on a washing machine, a refrigerator with a cycling compressor, or a table on a non-rigid floor in a high-traffic area, the seismic vibrations may cross the interrupt threshold. In a vehicle, the thermal expansion and contraction of plastic interior panels (the "creaking" heard as a car cools down) can generate sufficient impulse shock to trigger the sensor if the tag is wedged tightly against the panel.⁷  
* **Vector 2: The Bluetooth "Faraday" Effect.** A common user error involves placing the AirTag deep within a bag or vehicle chassis that effectively acts as a Faraday cage. Even if the owner is technically "nearby" (e.g., in the driver's seat), the attenuation of the 2.4 GHz Bluetooth signal may prevent the cryptographic handshake. Consequently, the AirTag's internal timer $T_{sep}$ continues to count. Once it crosses the 8–24 hour threshold, the tag considers itself "Separated." At this point, the vibration of the car starting (movement) triggers the sound, confusing the owner who believes they have been "with" the tag the whole time.  
* **Vector 3: Firmware "Panic" States.** While rare, edge cases in the firmware may trigger a sound if the internal state machine becomes corrupted or if a battery voltage droop causes a brownout reset. A reset AirTag emits a startup chime, which is frequently misidentified by users as a tracking alert.

## **4. Google Find My Device (FMDN) and the DULT Standard**

The ecosystem for Android—comprising devices like the Chipolo One Point, Chipolo Card Point, Pebblebee Clip, and Moto Tag—operates under the "Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers" (DULT) specification developed jointly by Apple, Google, and the IETF. This standardization introduces a more transparent, yet equally complex, set of state transitions.

### **4.1 The "Near-Owner" and "Separated" States**

Unlike the proprietary obscurity of Apple's initial launch, the DULT specification¹ clearly defines the device states. FMDN trackers maintain a state variable that dictates their advertising payload.

* **Near-Owner State:** In this state, the tracker assumes it is safe. It advertises a rotating MAC address and an Ephemeral ID (EID) that changes frequently—typically every 15 minutes or 1024 seconds. This rapid rotation is a privacy feature to prevent third-party scanning infrastructure (like retail beacons) from tracking the owner.¹⁶  
* **Separated State:** The transition to the Separated state occurs when the tracker fails to connect to the bonded owner device for a relatively short duration, often defined as **30 minutes** in the DULT drafts.¹⁶ However, entering the Separated *state* does not immediately trigger the alarm; it merely starts the countdown for the "Unwanted Tracking" mode.

### **4.2 Unwanted Tracking (UT) Mode**

The UT Mode is the critical operational phase for anti-stalking alerts. When a device has been in the Separated state for an extended period, it alters its behavior to become more visible to detection networks.

* **Static MAC Address:** Crucially, upon entering UT Mode, the tracker ceases the rapid rotation of its MAC address. The MAC address rotation slows significantly, often persisting for **24 hours**. This allows the "Unknown Tracker Alert" algorithms on Android and iOS devices to recognize the device as a persistent companion rather than a series of transient devices passing by.¹⁷  
* **The UT Flag:** The Bluetooth Low Energy advertising payload includes a specific bit—DULT_ACCESSORY_CAPABILITY_MOTION_DETECTOR_UT_BIT_POS—that signals to scanning devices that this tracker is in a separated/lost state and supports motion-detected sound.¹⁸

### **4.3 Autonomous Sound Logic in DULT Devices**

The DULT specification mandates that trackers support an audible alert to locate the device. For autonomous triggering (i.e., the tracker beeping without a phone command), the FMDN implementation mirrors the Apple logic to ensure cross-compatibility and safety.

* **Time Window:** The standard window for enabling the autonomous motion-gated sound is **8 to 24 hours** of separation.¹⁵  
* **Motion Trigger:** Similar to AirTags, FMDN trackers utilize accelerometer interrupts to wake the device and play a sound. The specific hardware implementation varies by manufacturer, but the logic remains consistent: If (State == UT_MODE && Time > Alert_Window && Motion == Detected) -> Play_Sound().

## **5. Hardware Anatomy and Sensor Specifics**

To provide the precise technical knowledge requested for debugging, we must examine the specific components used in these devices. The user's question regarding whether a movement sensor is installed ("do these devices include a motion sensor?") can be answered affirmatively and specifically.

### **5.1 Chipolo One Point (Google FMDN)**

The Chipolo One Point is a flagship device for the Google Find My Device network. Teardown analysis and component documentation confirm the integration of specialized MEMS hardware.

* **Accelerometer:** The device utilizes the **Bosch BMA530** (or equivalent low-power variant in newer batches). This is a 3-axis, ultra-low-power accelerometer designed specifically for wearables and IoT devices.¹⁰  
* **Interrupt Logic:** The BMA530 is configured to use its "Significant Motion" or "Any-Motion" interrupt features. This allows the main System-on-Chip (SoC) to sleep in deep standby, consuming micro-amps of current, while the accelerometer independently monitors for acceleration forces. When the threshold is breached, the BMA530 sends a hardware interrupt signal to the SoC, waking it to check the separation timer and potentially drive the piezo buzzer.  
* **Sensitivity:** The BMA530 is highly sensitive. It can be configured to detect acceleration changes as low as a few milli-g's. This confirms that "unmoved" to the human eye (e.g., sliding a bag gently across a table) is indeed "movement" to the sensor.

### **5.2 Pebblebee Clip (Google FMDN)**

The Pebblebee Clip utilizes a similar architecture but differs in power source and firmware integration.

* **Power Source:** Unlike the coin-cell powered Chipolo and AirTag, the Pebblebee Clip uses a rechargeable lithium battery. This allows for a potentially louder speaker and different power management profiles.  
* **SoC Integration:** Pebblebee devices typically utilize Nordic Semiconductor nRF52 series chips, which have robust support for the DULT motion_detector module in their SDK.²⁰ The firmware logic integrates the accelerometer data to manage the "Left Behind" and "Unwanted Tracking" states.

## **6. Mathematical Analysis of the GPS Drift Hypothesis**

The user specifically requested an analysis of the hypothesis that "GPS drift (100–200 m) of the mobile phone simulates movement" (*in particular with regard to the hypothesis that GPS drift (100–200 m) of the phone simulates movement*). This requires a rigorous distinction between the *tracker's* reality and the *phone's* reality.

### **6.1 The Inertial Frame of Reference (Tracker)**

Hypothesis Status: Rejected for Autonomous Ringing.  
As established, the trackers are GPS-blind. They operate in an inertial frame of reference.  
Let $A_{tag}$ be the acceleration vector measured by the tracker's accelerometer.  
Let $V_{phone}$ be the velocity vector calculated by the phone's GPS.  
If the tracker is stationary on a table:

$$A_{tag} \approx \langle 0, 0, 1g \rangle$$  

(registering only gravity).  
Even if the phone's GPS calculates a false displacement $\Delta X = 200m$ due to signal multipath or ionospheric delay, the physical force $F$ acting on the tracker is zero ($F=ma$). The BMA530 accelerometer measures 0g of dynamic acceleration.  
Therefore, the autonomous sound trigger (Vector B) cannot be activated by GPS drift. The tracker simply does not know the phone is "moving."

### **6.2 The Relativistic False Positive (Handset Notification)**

Hypothesis Status: Confirmed for System Notifications.  
While the tracker won't beep autonomously, GPS drift is a primary cause of false positive notifications on the handset (Vector A), which often leads users to believe the tracker is malfunctioning.  
The "Unknown Tracker Alert" algorithm on the smartphone relies on a spatial-temporal correlation.

1. **Phone State:** The phone is stationary, but GPS drift creates a "Ghost Path." The phone calculates it has moved from Point A to Point B (distance 200 m) over time $t$.  
2. **Scanner State:** The phone's Bluetooth radio continuously sees the tracker's MAC address with a relatively constant RSSI (since both are actually stationary).  
3. **Algorithmic Error:** The algorithm interprets this data: "I have moved 200 m. This Bluetooth device has remained at a constant distance from me throughout this movement. Therefore, the device must be moving *with* me."  
4. **Result:** The phone displays: "Tracker Detected Traveling With You."  
5. **User Confusion:** The user, seeing this alert while sitting on their couch, assumes the tracker is "acting up." If they press "Play Sound" on the notification, the tracker rings. The user then correlates "GPS Drift" with "Tracker Ringing," even though the ringing was manually invoked via the false positive notification.

## **7. Forensic Debugging: Identifying the Cause of Sporadic Ringing**

When a user reports a "sporadically ringing tracker," the issue is rarely the intended anti-stalking logic functioning correctly. Instead, it is usually a hardware fault, a firmware edge case, or a misunderstanding of the alert types. The following sections detail the specific failure modes for Chipolo and Pebblebee devices identified during deep research.

### **7.1 The Chipolo One Point "Spring" Failure**

A significant number of user reports and technical investigations have identified a mechanical design flaw in the Chipolo One Point (Google FMDN version). The device uses a CR2032 battery held in place by a side-mounted negative contact spring.²¹

* **Failure Mode:** The spring tension can be insufficient, or the battery cap design may allow for slight movement. If the device is subjected to thermal shock (e.g., bringing keys from a cold winter exterior into a warm house) or minor impact, the plastic casing expands or shifts, causing the spring to lose contact with the battery for a fraction of a second.  
* **Brown-out Reset:** This momentary power loss causes the Nordic SoC to reboot.  
* **The Symptom:** Upon reboot, the Chipolo One Point plays its standard "Power On" chime. This is a short, cheerful melody.  
* **Misdiagnosis:** Users perceive this random chirping as a "phantom alert" or an "anti-stalking beep." However, the anti-stalking sound is typically a repetitive, urgent alarm, distinct from the startup chime.  
* **Correction:** This is a hardware/mechanical fault, not a software/GPS issue. Debugging requires bending the spring to increase tension or placing a small shim (piece of paper) on top of the battery to ensure a tighter fit.

### **7.2 Pebblebee App vs. Network Conflict**

Pebblebee devices offer a unique "Universal" capability, allowing them to function on either the Apple or Google network, or via the proprietary Pebblebee app. However, these modes are generally mutually exclusive regarding the "Left Behind" logic.²²

* **Conflict:** If a user attempts to use the Pebblebee App for "Left Behind" alerts while simultaneously enrolled in the Google FMDN, the firmware logic may conflict. The proprietary app uses a direct Bluetooth link to the phone to determine proximity. If this link is unstable (due to Android's aggressive battery management killing the app process), the tag may beep to signal it has been left behind, even if the FMDN logic (which is deeper in the OS) sees the tag as safe.  
* **Correction:** Technical recommendation is to perform a factory reset and pair *only* to the Google Find My Device network, foregoing the proprietary app to eliminate conflicting logic streams.

### **7.3 Environmental Triggers (The "Unmoved" Fallacy)**

For devices that are physically intact and correctly paired, "phantom" ringing is often caused by environmental factors that trigger the accelerometer despite the object appearing stationary to a human observer.

* **Seismic Vibration:** The Bosch BMA530 is sensitive enough to detect footsteps on a wooden floor or the vibration of a washing machine in the next room. If a tracker is in the "Primed" state (Separated > 8–24 h), these vibrations are sufficient to trigger the alert.  
* **Acoustic Resonance:** Extremely loud environments (e.g., a concert or near a subwoofer) can mechanically couple with the MEMS structure, simulating movement.

## **8. Summary of Technical Triggers and Debugging Matrix**

To assist the technical team in debugging, the following comparative matrix summarizes the findings.

| Feature | Apple AirTag | Chipolo One Point (FMDN) | Pebblebee Clip (FMDN) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Separation Window** | Randomized **8 to 24 hours** post-handshake failure. | **~30 mins** to "Separated" State; **8–24 hours** to Audio Enable. | **~30 mins** to "Separated" State; **8–24 hours** to Audio Enable. |
| **Reset Mechanism** | Cryptographic handshake with paired iPhone. | Connection with Owner Device (clears UT flag). | Connection with Owner Device. |
| **Motion Sensor** | Custom Accelerometer (High Sensitivity). | **Bosch BMA530** MEMS Accelerometer.¹⁰ | Integrated MEMS Motion Detector. |
| **Autonomous Trigger** | Timer ($T > 8$–$24h$) **AND** Rotation > 10° / Vibration. | Timer ($T > 8$–$24h$) **AND** BMA530 Interrupt. | Timer ($T > 8$–$24h$) **AND** Motion Wake Event. |
| **GPS Dependency** | **None.** Tracker is inertial-only. | **None.** Tracker is inertial-only. | **None.** Tracker is inertial-only. |
| **Primary "Phantom" Cause** | 1. Bluetooth Interference (Faraday effect in cars). 2. Micro-vibrations in "Primed" state. | **Battery Spring Contact Failure** (Rebooting causes startup chime).²¹ | **Firmware Conflict** (Proprietary App vs. FMDN logic). |
| **GPS Drift Role** | Causes False Positive **Phone Notifications**. | Causes False Positive **Phone Notifications**. | Causes False Positive **Phone Notifications**. |

### **8.1 Final Technical Conclusions**

1. **GPS Drift is a Red Herring for Autonomous Sound:** The hypothesis that GPS drift causes the tracker to ring *on its own* is technically unfounded. The trackers lack the necessary hardware (GNSS receivers) to detect such drift. However, GPS drift is the leading cause of false positive *system notifications* on the handset, which often leads to user confusion.  
2. **The "Unmoved" Condition:** A tracker is rarely truly "unmoved" in the eyes of a MEMS accelerometer. If the separation timer (8–24 h) has elapsed, the threshold for triggering a sound is exceptionally low (10-degree rotation or minor vibration).  
3. **Hardware Failure Masquerading as Feature:** For the Chipolo One Point specifically, sporadic chirping is statistically most likely to be a mechanical failure of the battery contact spring causing spurious reboots, rather than a genuine activation of the DULT anti-stalking logic. This can be verified by identifying the sound pattern (Melodic Startup vs. Repetitive Alarm).

By applying this forensic understanding of the separation state machine and sensor limitations, technical teams can accurately diagnose whether a "phantom ring" is a legitimate safety alert, a software artifact of GPS drift, or a mechanical hardware fault.
