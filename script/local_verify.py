# script/local_verify.py
"""Run the canonical local verification commands for Google Find My.

The script has two modes:

* Without arguments it runs ``ruff format --check`` followed by
  pytest-homeassistant-custom-component and the pycache cleanup, exactly as
  ``README.md`` and ``AGENTS.md`` describe it. The commands are the same as
  before; one thing did change, and it changed for both modes: they now run
  with the repository root as their working directory. Called from a
  subdirectory, ``ruff format --check`` used to inspect that subtree and now
  inspects the repository, and a relative path in ``--pytest-args`` is now
  resolved from the root.
* ``--all`` runs the full local preflight S1 to S8 and prints a report. Every
  stage reports one of ``OK``, ``FAILED``, ``NOTE`` or ``NOT CHECKED`` together
  with a reason and the tool version it used. A stage that could not run must
  never look like a stage that passed, and a version mismatch against the CI
  pins must be visible at once rather than after a red pipeline.

Preview without running anything expensive: ``--all --skip-pytest`` reports S5
and S6 as ``NOT CHECKED`` and still prints the static stages.

If command-line shims such as ``pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`` are
unavailable, use the module invocation fallbacks described in ``AGENTS.md``
(for example, ``python -m pytest_homeassistant_custom_component``) to mirror the
expected checks.
