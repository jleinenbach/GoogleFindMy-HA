"""Report statement coverage for the lines this branch changed.

Codecov reports a patch status on every pull request; this script answers the
same question locally, without adding ``diff-cover`` as a dependency. It reads a
Cobertura ``coverage.xml`` (the per-line hit list that ``pytest --cov-report=xml``
writes) and ``git diff --unified=0 <base>`` (the changed line numbers, merge base
against the working tree), then intersects the two.

Three decisions keep the number comparable to Codecov rather than merely
plausible:

* **Uninstrumented files are listed, never counted.** ``[tool.coverage.run]
  source`` covers ``custom_components/googlefindmy`` only, so ``tests/``,
  ``script/`` and ``docs/`` have no entry in the XML at all. Counting their
  changed lines as uncovered would report nonsense; dropping them silently would
  make the quotient unexplainable. They get their own counted line instead.
* **The base is the merge base, not a fixed commit.** ``git merge-base
  origin/main HEAD``, so the number does not wander when ``main`` moves. The
  other end of the diff is the working tree rather than ``HEAD``, because the
  coverage report comes from a run over the working tree; both sides of the
  intersection have to describe the same revision.
* **The measurement is statement based.** ``coverage.xml`` also carries a branch
  rate, and the terminal report of ``pytest --cov`` combines both. A patch
  coverage is per line ("executed or not"), so the branch rate is neither used
  nor mixed in. For the same reason the default threshold is the *statement*
  rate of the baseline run and not the combined project percentage.

Preview without a run of your own: point ``--coverage-xml`` at any existing
``coverage.xml`` and ``--base`` at any ref; nothing is written, the report goes
to stdout.

Exit status: ``0`` at or above the threshold, ``2`` below it (the measurement
itself succeeded), ``3`` when no instrumented statement changed at all, and ``1``
when the measurement could not be taken. Status ``3`` exists because "nothing to
measure" must not share an exit code with "measured and fine": a diff that only
touches tests and docs would otherwise report a passing patch coverage. Falling below
the threshold is deliberately not an abort: the report names the uncovered lines
so that the choice between "add a test" and "justify the line" is made at the
line, not here.
