    The comparative half of the fusion's rejection logic, extracted so the two
    overlap-free situations share ONE rule instead of two that drift apart: a
    clear jump away from an ordinary cached fix, and a clear jump away from a
    trusted semantic anchor. On rejection this also retains the coarse fix as
    side information and counts the rejection, so the caller only has to honour
    the boolean.

    It is a COMPARISON, never an absolute cut-off. Its removed predecessor
    (``min_accuracy_threshold``, const default 100 m) discarded on the incoming
    radius alone and froze trackers; a fix with a wide radius still tells us the
    city, and without any fix we would not even know that. So nothing is
    discarded unless a better, reliable and still-fresh alternative is actually
    present.

    Deliberately NO own-report bypass, unlike the speed gate (whose bypass is
    about cryptographic provenance, i.e. whether the report can be trusted).
    This gate is about physical uncertainty, and a phone reports ITS OWN
    position, not the tracker's: an own fix with a 1600 m radius is exactly as
    coarse as a foreign one.

    Staleness is read from the shared ``stale_threshold`` option, not from a
    second time constant, and it is the age against the wall clock - not the
    distance between the two report timestamps the speed gate uses. An unknown
    age counts as not-trustworthy, so the incoming fix wins.

    No round-trip anchor is seeded or consumed here (F-CODEX-6 keeps anchor
    provenance bound to the speed gate's one-shot semantics).

    WHY A MODULE FUNCTION AND NOT A METHOD: every fusion suite builds its
    coordinator double as ``MagicMock(spec=CacheOperations)``. A method of that
    class is auto-mocked there and returns a truthy ``Mock``, so the gate would
    silently reject EVERY payload in eight existing suites - measured: nine
    round-trip cases went red on exactly that. A module-level function cannot be
    shadowed by the spec, so those doubles keep exercising the real rule, which

        MUST be called on every path that feeds a fix into the fusion, and

        # assignment remains a guard: the significance gate (_is_significant_update)
        # is the authoritative writer downstream.
