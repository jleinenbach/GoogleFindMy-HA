"""Device registry operations for GoogleFindMyCoordinator.

This module contains registry-related methods extracted from main.py
during Phase 2 of the refactoring.

Methods moved here:
- _call_device_registry_api: Core registry call with compatibility handling
- _apply_device_ownership: The coordinator's execution point for ownership changes
- _device_registry_capabilities: Signature-derived capability profile
- _report_unmigrated_ownership_kwargs: Brake against pre-2026.8 keywords
- _device_registry_kwargs_need_legacy_retry: Legacy kwarg detection
- _device_registry_build_legacy_kwargs: Legacy kwarg translation
- _device_registry_config_subentry_kwarg_name: Subentry kwarg detection
- _device_registry_allows_translation_update: Translation support check
- _reindex_poll_targets_from_device_registry: Rebuild poll target sets
- _extract_our_identifier: Extract device identifier from registry
- _sync_owner_index: Sync hass.data owner index for FCM fallback
- _ensure_device_name_cache: Lazy device-name cache initialization
- _apply_pending_via_updates: Deprecated no-op (backward compat)
- _device_display_name: Get device name without sensitive data
- _entry_id: Get bound ConfigEntry ID
- _config_entry_exists: Check if config entry is registered

# Two-stage emergency brake for ownership keywords that were not migrated to

# every call site speaks intents; doing it earlier would have made each
# intermediate commit non-functional on Core 2026.8+, where the old keywords
# still parse and where ``add_``/``remove_`` together form a working move.
# It stays a switch rather than being hard-wired: the "report" stage keeps the
# warning/debug levels alive and under test. There is no runtime option behind
# it; reaching that stage means editing this line or patching it in a test. A
# test reads this constant without patching it, so an edit back to "report"
# turns that test red instead of passing unnoticed.

        come through here any more; they go through
        :meth:`_apply_device_ownership`, which asks
        :meth:`_device_registry_capabilities` for the right keyword.

        The preference order lives in
        :attr:`DeviceRegistryCapabilities.subentry_kwarg_for_shim` and is
        deliberately the historical one: a callable that still accepts the bare
        ``config_subentry_id`` gets it, and ``new_config_subentry_id`` is never
        returned. Handing out the newer spelling here would silently turn this
        shim back into an ownership-changing path, and on Core 2026.8+ that is
        the difference between a no-op and a move.

        Version note corrected: the rename predates our declared minimum.
        Tag ``2025.9.1`` already ships ``add_config_subentry_id`` on
        ``async_update_device`` (``homeassistant/helpers/device_registry.py``,
        line 1014 in that tag) and no longer accepts ``config_subentry_id``
        there at all (signature at line 1009). The legacy branch below
        therefore serves no supported core any more, only registry doubles in
        tests. It stays for now; removing it is a separate change.

        Note also that ``async_get_or_create`` keeps ``config_subentry_id`` in
        *every* release up to 2026.9 (verified at tags 2025.9.1, 2026.8.0 and
        2026.9.0), which is why that call needs no special case here: the
        preference order picks the bare name for it anyway. Ownership *changes*
        must not come through this helper at all; see
        :meth:`_apply_device_ownership` and ``docs/AI_DEPRECATIONS_GUIDE.md``,

        This is where the coordinator changes which config entry or subentry
        owns a device. It is not the only executor in the integration: call
        sites without a coordinator instance (``services.py`` and
        ``config_flow.py``) run their plan through
        ``execute_ownership_plan`` in the helpers module. What must stay single
        is the *translation*, and that is ``plan_device_ownership``, which both
        executors use. This method adds what only coordinator call sites need:
        the unmigrated-keyword brake and the ``config_subentry_id``
        compatibility shim. Call sites state an intent; the keywords are chosen
        by ``plan_device_ownership`` from the signature of the installed core.
        See ``docs/AI_DEPRECATIONS_GUIDE.md``, section VI.

        ``device`` is the device entry the caller already holds. When it is
        absent, the intent needs the current ownership (DETACH, ENSURE) and the
        core uses the single-owner model, this method resolves it first: DETACH
        must never run on an unknown ownership state, because on that core
        dropping the owning entry deletes the device and every entity attached
        to it. MOVE does not read the current ownership and skips the lookup.

        Args:
            dev_reg: The device registry.
            intent: MOVE, ENSURE or DETACH.
            device_id: The device to act on.
            entry_id: Our config entry.
            target_subentry_id: Where the device shall sit (MOVE, ENSURE).
            detach_subentry_id: Which link to give up (DETACH, legacy MOVE).
                ``None`` names the hub link, that is the device sitting directly
                on the entry. Leaving the argument out is a different statement:
                it lets the planner read the link from the current ownership.
            device: The device entry, when the caller already holds it.
            extra: Additional keyword arguments for the update call, for
                example ``name``. Ownership and subentry keywords do not belong
                in here: a ``config_subentry_id`` would pass through the
                compatibility shim and arrive as ``add_config_subentry_id`` next
                to the ``new_*`` pair, which Core 2026.8+ rejects with
                ``HomeAssistantError``. Use ``target_subentry_id`` instead.

        Returns:

            The caller reaches this only when the device carries a hub link
            *and* a service subentry exists, so the intent is a MOVE and not a
            DETACH. That distinction is not cosmetic. On a single-owner core a
            hub link means the device really sits on the entry root, and a
            DETACH of that link is the call that deletes the device together
            with every entity attached to it. MOVE reaches the same end state
            on both core generations and deletes nothing.

            Unreachable on both core generations, and that is measured, not
            derived: the healing step above runs first and names the hub link
            as the one to detach, so no hub link is left when this is asked
            (with the legacy double, whose ``add_config_subentry_id`` is a set
            union like Core 2025.9, the healing branch is hit and this one is
            not). The MOVE here is therefore precaution rather than a fix for
            a reachable defect, and it is worth having for exactly that
            reason: the branch is one condition away from being reachable
            again. The ``service_config_subentry_id is None`` guard below is

        ``_enabled_poll_device_ids`` is entity-driven but rebuilt only from
        *device* registry events, and this coordinator subscribes to no entity
        registry channel. A brand-new tracker gets its device registry entry
        from ``_ensure_registry_for_devices`` **before** its entity exists, so
        the event that rebuild triggers sees the device as present but not
        enabled. Nothing revisits that verdict: the polling predicate admits a
        device that is either enabled or not present at all, so from the next
        cycle on the new tracker is excluded -- present, never enabled -- until
        the entry is reloaded or Home Assistant restarts.

        The platform therefore calls this once the additions it scheduled have
        reached the entity registry. Re-deriving both sets from the registries
        is idempotent, and it refreshes the subentry index along with them, so
        the stored metadata stops calling the device disabled while its entity
        already publishes state.

        **Not during early setup.** The refresh underneath runs without
        ``skip_manager_update``, so calling this while the stubbed
        ``ConfigEntrySubEntryManager`` is still bound would mutate it, which the
        repository contract forbids for coordinator metadata probes. The only
        caller today is the tracker registry probe, which fires a full grace
        period after setup; a new caller inside ``async_setup_entry`` needs the
        flag plumbed through first.
