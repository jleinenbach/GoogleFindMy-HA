    """Translate ownership keywords for cores that predate the current names.

    Mapping applied here:
    - add_config_entry_id -> config_entry_id
    - add_config_subentry_id -> config_subentry_id
    - remove_config_subentry_id -> dropped, it has no legacy counterpart

    **The surviving half, and why it stays.** ``AGENTS.md`` forbids dropping one
    half of the removal pair, because on a subentry-aware core
    ``remove_config_entry_id`` alone means "remove every subentry link of this
    entry" and deletes a device that held only one. The rule is not waived here;
    what carries this exception is reach, not a claim that such a core has no
    subentry links. It may well have them, under the older
    ``config_subentry_id`` spelling, which is exactly the core this translator
    models.

    **Reach, derived from the code rather than assumed:**
    :func:`needs_legacy_kwarg_retry` returns ``False`` immediately while
    :attr:`DeviceRegistryCapabilities.subentry_kwarg_for_shim` resolves to
    ``add_config_subentry_id``, that is while the signature carries no bare
    ``config_subentry_id``. At tag ``2025.9.1`` ``async_update_device`` carries
    ``add_config_subentry_id`` and no bare spelling, and the declared minimum is
    that tag. This translator therefore serves registry doubles and cores below
    the declared minimum. The behaviour it produces is pinned by
    ``tests/test_coordinator.py::test_device_registry_wrapper_retries_with_legacy_remove_config_subentry_kwarg``;
    if a supported core ever reintroduced the bare spelling as an alias, this
    exception would have to be revisited rather than inherited.

    Version note corrected: the rename predates our declared minimum.
    Tag ``2025.9.1`` already ships ``add_config_subentry_id`` on
    ``async_update_device`` (``homeassistant/helpers/device_registry.py``, line
    1014 in that tag). This *naming* branch therefore serves registry doubles
    rather than supported cores, unlike the legacy *ownership* path that emits
    the ``add_*``/``remove_*`` quadruple, which is live on the declared minimum.
    Note that ``async_get_or_create`` keeps
    ``config_subentry_id`` in *every* release up to 2026.9: the keyword choice
    is a distinction between callers, not between core versions.

    Do not read this translator as a licence to write the old keywords. From
    Core 2026.8 ``add_config_entry_id`` attaches nothing and
    ``remove_config_entry_id`` on the owning entry deletes the device; see
    ``docs/AI_DEPRECATIONS_GUIDE.md``, section VI.

    ``current`` is the ownership read from the device entry, or ``None`` when the
    caller did not resolve the device. On cores below 2026.8 a device entry has
    no ``config_entry_id`` attribute, so ``current`` is ``None`` there. The
    legacy DETACH and ENSURE branches ignore it; the legacy MOVE reads
    ``current.subentry_id`` as a fallback, but only when ``detach_subentry_id``
    was omitted.

    ``detach_subentry_id`` names the link to give up: ``None`` means the hub link
    (the device sitting directly on the entry). It is *not* interchangeable with
    ``target_subentry_id``. Core only removes ownership when the removed subentry
    matches the one the device actually sits in; see
    ``homeassistant/helpers/device_registry.py``, ``async_update_device``, the
    branch guarded by ``remove_config_entry_id == old.config_entry_id`` and a
    matching ``remove_config_subentry_id``.

    Args:
        intent: What the caller wants to achieve.
        caps: Capability profile of the installed ``async_update_device``.
        device_id: The device to act on.

        detach_subentry_id: Which link to give up (DETACH, legacy MOVE).

            operation. Ownership and subentry keywords do not belong in here;
            use the parameters above. A removal and an empty plan carry no
            keywords at all, so ``extra`` has no effect in those branches.

    Returns:
        Zero or more operations, in execution order. An empty tuple means
        "nothing to do", which is observably different from an update that
        changes nothing: it produces no deprecation report and no registry event.
        It is only returned when there is genuinely nothing left: an ENSURE on a
        device that already sits right still emits the update when ``extra``
        carries metadata, because that metadata is not part of the ownership
        question and must not disappear with it.

    Raises:
        ValueError: On a single-owner core, when the intent cannot be carried
            out without knowing the current ownership: DETACH always, ENSURE
            when no ``target_subentry_id`` was given.

    Caller responsibility, because this function cannot check it: ENSURE on a
    device owned by *another* config entry takes that device over, silently and
    by design, because "make sure it sits here" says nothing about where it sat
    before. Every call site today resolves its device through the entry-scoped
    :func:`resolve_device_by_identifiers` or behind
    :func:`device_belongs_to_entry`, so a foreign device never reaches it. A
    future call site that hands over a device from a registry-wide scan would

    """Resolve a registry entry from ``candidates``, highest priority first.

    This is the single place in the integration that looks a device up by
    identifier. Call it instead of ``async_get_device``; do not build the entry
    scoping by hand at a call site.

    Priority is explicit: the caller orders ``candidates`` and the first hit
    wins. Before Core 2026.8 the call sites passed the whole set to a single
    ``async_get_device`` call, whose result depended on set iteration order and
    could resolve to a device owned by a *different* GoogleFindMy config entry
    that still carried the legacy unscoped identifier. Scoping the lookup to
    ``entry_id`` removes that cross-entry hit. That is a deliberate narrowing,
    not a regression: a device owned by another entry was never a valid answer.

    Core matrix:

    * ``2026.8.0`` and newer: ``async_get_device_by_identifier`` takes **one**
      identifier tuple plus the owning entry id and cannot be ambiguous
      (``homeassistant/helpers/device_registry.py`` at tag ``2026.9.0``, line
      1999).
    * up to ``2026.7``: neither that method nor ``async_get_devices`` exists, so
      the legacy branch below is the only one that runs on our declared minimum
      core ``2025.9.1``. Do not delete it as dead code.

    ``async_get_devices`` is deliberately not used as a middle step. It arrives
    in the very same core release (``2026.8.0``), so a registry that lacks
    ``async_get_device_by_identifier`` lacks it too and a registry that has the
    former never reaches the legacy branch. It also returns an unordered list,
    which would put the priority back into implicit code. It stays the right
    call wherever a *set* of devices is wanted, which is nowhere here.

    Core 2026.9 adds a main/child device distinction where this lookup searches
    main devices only (tag ``2026.9.0``, lines 1999-2021). This integration
    registers no child devices: it never calls ``async_get_or_create_child`` and
    never sets ``parent_device_id``. ``via_device`` is a different relation and
    does not make a device a child. Revisit this function if that changes.

    Args:
        dev_reg: The device registry, or any object with the same surface.
        candidates: ``(domain, identifier)`` tuples, highest priority first.

    owning entries in ``config_entries``, which does not exist there.

    ``config_entries`` is **not** gone on the newer core: it survives as a
    deprecated compatibility shim (a property, checked at tag ``2026.8.0``,

    ``config_entry_id`` is the same deliberate narrowing that
    :func:`resolve_device_by_identifiers` applies: an entry we do not own was
