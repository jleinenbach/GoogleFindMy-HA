## Cross-reference index

* [`tests/AGENTS.md`](../../tests/AGENTS.md) — Discovery and reconfigure test stubs, including the lightweight `ConfigEntry` doubles referenced below.

## Config flow registration expectations

* `ConfigFlow.domain` **must** remain explicitly declared in `config_flow.py`. This guards against future upstream changes that might stop injecting the attribute via metaclass magic.
* Do **not** hand-register the flow through `config_entries.HANDLERS` unless Home Assistant drops automatic registration. If a regression forces a manual fallback, document the affected core versions, link the upstream issue, and add a TODO describing when to remove the workaround.
* Tests under `tests/test_config_flow_registration.py` cover both the domain attribute and automatic handler registration. Update them whenever the runtime behavior changes so the expectations stay enforced.
* Reference the Home Assistant developer docs on [config flow registries and handlers](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/config_entries_config_flow_handler/#config-flow-handler-registration) when validating upstream behavior; keep this section aligned with any future changes noted there.
* When config flows iterate existing entries, guard optional Home Assistant attributes (for example, `ConfigEntry.source`) so discovery update stubs and other test doubles without those attributes keep working during local runs.

#### Optional `ConfigEntry` attributes in tests

Local discovery and reconfigure tests instantiate lightweight `ConfigEntry` doubles that frequently omit optional attributes Home Assistant adds at runtime.

* `source` — prefer `getattr(entry, "source", None)` before accessing the field so `async_step_discovery` continues to work with the stubs in `tests/test_config_flow_discovery.py`.
* `pref_disable_new_entities` / `pref_disable_polling` — guard these through `getattr(..., False)` when feature toggles depend on them, because flow helpers in the test suite never populate the preferences block.
* `state` — normalize through `getattr(entry, "state", None)` before checking reload eligibility; the discovery update fixtures only set `entry_id`, `data`, and sometimes `unique_id`.

Add similar guards whenever a new optional attribute becomes relevant so future config flow helpers remain compatible with the suite's minimal stubs.

## Service validation fallbacks

* When raising `ServiceValidationError`, always include both the translation metadata (`translation_domain`, `translation_key`, and `translation_placeholders`) **and** a sanitized `message` that reuses the same placeholders. This keeps UI translations working while ensuring Home Assistant surfaces a readable fallback when translations are unavailable.

#### Fallback verification checklist

1. Run `pytest tests/test_hass_data_layout.py::test_service_no_active_entry_placeholders -q` to confirm placeholder usage remains stable.
2. Add new translation-focused tests alongside updates so each fallback path has coverage.

## Typing reminders

* Prefer importing container ABCs (for example, `Iterable`, `Mapping`, `Sequence`) from `collections.abc` rather than `typing` so runtime imports stay lightweight and ruff avoids duplicate definition warnings.
* When adding iterable-type annotations inside `config_flow.py`, reuse the existing `CollIterable` alias to keep type hints consistent with the options-flow helpers and avoid reintroducing stray `typing.Iterable` imports.
