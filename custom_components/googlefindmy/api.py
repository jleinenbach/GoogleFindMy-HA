# custom_components/googlefindmy/api.py
"""API wrapper for Google Find My Device (async-first, HA-friendly).

This module encapsulates all network interactions with Google's Find My Device
backend and exposes a small, HA-oriented API surface:

- Device enumeration (lightweight list w/ capability hints).
- Per-device location retrieval.
- Action endpoints (play/stop sound) using the shared FCM receiver.

Token/Auth handling (Step 5.1-D):
- **401/403 (auth failures)** raised by Nova helpers are mapped to
  `homeassistant.exceptions.ConfigEntryAuthFailed` so the *coordinator* can
  trigger HA’s re-auth UX and Repairs issue workflow. One documented
  asymmetry: the per-device location path converts only a PERMANENT auth
  failure (and an HTTP 401/403). A plain non-permanent 403 is re-raised as
  `NovaAuthError` on purpose, because the polling coordinator counts
  consecutive transient auth failures and escalates at its own threshold
  rather than on the first occurrence.
  Every handler branches on the STATUS, via
  `NovaApi.nova_request.is_credential_rejection`: permanent first, then 401/403,
  an unreadable status keeps the conservative verdict. That matters because the
  transport raises `NovaAuthError` for every non-retryable 4xx (400, 404, 405,
  409, 422 included), so a type check reads "device not found" as "your sign-in
  expired". A non-credential rejection therefore leaves the device list as
  `UpdateFailed`, and the location request passes the error on to its callers,
  whose own branches skip the device without touching the re-auth machinery. It
  is deliberately NOT collapsed to an empty result: both callers read a
  non-raising return as proof that the credentials work and clear the auth state
  before they check for emptiness, so a permanently rejected tracker would have
  masked a real 401 on another tracker. `_classify_nova_auth_error` is the sound-path adapter over the
  same predicate. Still open, stated so it is not mistaken for coverage: the
  transport keeps raising a type named "auth" for all of them, so a future
  handler that reads the type instead of the predicate repeats the defect.
- **gpsoauth/ADM failures** (e.g., "BadAuthentication", "Missing 'Token' in gpsoauth")
  are normalized to `ConfigEntryAuthFailed` as well, even if they bubble up as a
  `RuntimeError`/`ValueError` rather than a `NovaAuthError`.
- Other server/network problems are treated as *transient*:
  - For device list: re-raised as `UpdateFailed` to keep coordinator semantics.
  - For per-device location and actions: logged and return {} / False to keep the
    polling cycle resilient (do not abort the sequential loop on a single error).

    Two independent facts are carried, and they must not be confused. ``outcome``
    names WHO refused: the server, the network, or this integration. ``cancel_key``
    answers only "may the device be ringing", which the transport latches onto the
    error (``NovaError.dispatched``) at its retry-loop choke point. Before this
    type existed, the second fact was the only one that survived the boundary, and
    the coordinator had to reconstruct the first from it, which is why a server
    rejection and a dead network both ended up as a push transport problem.

    A raised ``NovaError`` is never an acceptance (the submitter returns a tuple
    only on HTTP 200). The cancel key is preserved ONLY when the failure latched
    dispatch (``err.dispatched``): some attempt in the retry sequence reached the
    wire, so the device may already be ringing and a later Stop needs the key.
    Pure rejections (401/403/5xx/429
    with no wire-reaching attempt) and provable pre-dispatch failures inherit
    ``dispatched is False`` and drop the key, so they can never overwrite a

        This function requests the location for a specific device and selects the most

        **Auth mapping (5.1-D):**
            - `ConfigEntryAuthFailed` is raised ONLY where re-auth must start
              immediately, without a threshold in front of it: a `NovaHTTPError`
              with status 401/403, or a PERMANENT Nova auth failure (the
              `NovaAuthPermanentError` subclass, or a base `NovaAuthError`
              flagged `is_permanent=True` after the refresh sequence).
            - A plain, NON-permanent credential rejection -- in practice a 403,
              since a 401 that survives the refresh arrives flagged permanent --
              is re-raised as `NovaAuthError`, NOT converted. That is deliberate:
              the polling coordinator counts consecutive transient auth failures
              and escalates only at its own threshold, so converting here would
              prompt the user on the first occurrence. This asymmetry is the one
              difference to the device-list handler, which converts every
              credential rejection because it has no such counter behind it.
            - Any OTHER `NovaAuthError` is the server refusing the request, not
              the credentials -- a device removed from the account, a malformed
              body -- and is re-raised unchanged. It is deliberately NOT turned
              into an empty result: a normal return is what both callers read as
              "the credentials worked", and they clear the account auth state on
              it. Only a transient/5xx failure returns `{}`.
            - Because the previous two bullets BOTH arrive as `NovaAuthError`,
              the type alone never tells a caller which one it holds. Every
              caller must ask `nova_request.is_credential_rejection`.
            - Rate limit / other server issues are treated as transient and return `{}`.

        Args:
            device_id: The canonical ID of the device.
            device_name: The human-readable name of the device for logging.

        Returns:
            A dictionary containing the best available location data for the
            device, or an empty dictionary on a transient failure (5xx, rate
            limit, timeout). A normal return therefore means the credentials
            were accepted; callers rely on that.

        Raises:
            ConfigEntryAuthFailed: Re-auth must start at once -- an HTTP 401/403
                (`NovaHTTPError`), or a permanent Nova auth failure. The
                coordinator starts re-authentication.
            NovaAuthError: Everything else the transport raised under that name,
                re-raised unchanged. Two distinct cases share this exit: a
                NON-permanent credential rejection (403), which the polling
                coordinator counts toward its own threshold, and a server-side
                refusal of this request (a non-retryable 4xx such as 400/404/422)
                that says nothing about the credentials. Callers MUST tell them
                apart with `nova_request.is_credential_rejection`; the type does
                not, and reading the type is the defect this contract exists to
                prevent.

            a broken push transport, and only that value may make a caller arm a
            cooldown. `cancel_key` captures the client-generated cancel key and
            answers one question only: may the device be ringing. Never derive the
            cause from the key -- that out-of-band inference is what this type
            removes. The UUID is generated locally *before*
            dispatch. It is returned (non-None) in two cases where the device may
            be ringing and a later Stop needs the key:
              1. Acceptance — the server answered 200, `outcome` is `ACCEPTED`.
              2. Post-dispatch ambiguity — a network failure occurred at or after
                 the request reached the wire (server disconnect, read timeout,
                 payload error), so the play may have started even though no 200
                 was read. `outcome` is not `ACCEPTED`, but the key is preserved.
            Every failure that provably never reached the wire — no FCM token,
            missing cache, username/payload/token resolution, connection setup
            (DNS/connect refused/connect timeout) — and every explicit server
            rejection (401/403/4xx/5xx/429) returns a null `cancel_key` so it cannot
            overwrite a still-valid cancel key of a previous, possibly still-ringing
            play. The sole exception is a rejection/HTTP-status exit whose retry
            sequence latched dispatch on an *earlier* wire-reaching attempt: there
            the key is preserved because that earlier attempt may already be
            ringing. The pre-/post-dispatch split is classified in-band on the
            raised NovaError (`NovaError.dispatched`), stamped uniformly at the
            transport's retry-loop choke point for every exit. See
            IRR-CA-CANCEL-KEY-ON-SUCCESS-ONLY. On the Stop side the drop branch
            is additionally bound to "the cancel key was our own and fresh", so
            a foreign key passed in by a service call never evicts our handle.

            `ACCEPTED` means Nova accepted the submission (HTTP 200). This is
            NOT a confirmation that the device received or executed the command: no
            ExecuteActionResponse schema exists and no FCM callback is
            registered for sound, so nothing on this path can observe the ring.
