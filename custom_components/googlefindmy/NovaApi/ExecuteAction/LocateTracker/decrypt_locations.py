# IMPORTANT TERMINOLOGY:
# - EIK (Ephemeral Identity Key) = FMDN master secret for location decryption
#   and owner-specific operations (recovery_key, ringing_key, tracking_key are
#   derived from this). This is what we cache here.
# - IRK (Identity Resolving Key) = BLE-specific key for resolving resolvable
#   private addresses (Bluetooth Core Spec). NOT cached here and NOT used by
#   this integration.
#
# The EIK never changes unless the device is re-paired or the owner key
# version is rotated.
#
# Cache key: SHA-256 hash of (encrypted_identity_key + owner_key_version + flip_state)
# Cache value: Decrypted EIK bytes (32 bytes)
#
# Thread-safety: Access occurs only on the HA event loop (single-threaded),

    shared key, a partial server-field response, or a generic failure). This helper
    restores the discriminator as a typed class so the failure class name appears
    in logs and the coordinator can pick the correct recovery path. The caller
    preserves the original error via ``raise ... from exc``.

    Deterministic, field-specific matching (first match wins):
      (auth) a non-retryable structured ``error_kind`` (badauthentication /
          auth_error / invalid_grant) -> ``OwnerKeyInvalidError`` (reauth-worthy

          so a transient text that merely contains "401" (e.g. "retry after 4012
          ms") stays transient. See AP3.
      (a) ``InvalidTag`` -> ``SharedKeyMismatchError`` (genuine credential defect).
      (b) the shared key is genuinely absent/empty -> ``SharedKeyMissingError``
          (genuine credential defect). Recognised primarily by the TYPED
          ``SharedKeyUnavailableError`` raised at the retrieval source (robust to
          message wording, e.g. the non-interactive "shared key not available"
          case), and as a fallback by the legacy local "shared key ... missing or
          empty" message of the defensive empty-return guard in
          ``get_owner_key``.
      (b2) a local owner-key STRUCTURE defect (the stored owner key is missing,
          malformed, or the wrong length) -> ``_OwnerKeyRederiveRequired`` (an
          INTERNAL re-derive signal, NOT reauth). The defect is re-derivable from
          the (valid) shared key, so the caller force-refreshes the owner key once
          before deciding anything. Fail-safe transient subclass; never reauth.
      (c) a partial server-field response (``encryptedOwnerKeyAndMetadata`` /
          ``encryptedOwnerKey`` / "Decrypted owner_key is empty") ->
          ``OwnerKeyLookupTransientError`` (transient server condition).
      (d) everything else (default, inverted) -> ``OwnerKeyLookupTransientError``
          (no "stale" / "re-authenticate" guess).

    Order / reachability: the (auth) ``error_kind`` check runs first and is the
    only path that yields a reauth-worthy ``OwnerKeyInvalidError``. It is
    reachable via a bare ``RuntimeError`` carrying ``error_kind`` propagated from
    the ADM/owner-key getters; ``error_kind``-tagged errors carry none of the
    (a)-(c) wordings, so placing it first does not steal those branches.
    ``InvalidAasTokenError`` does NOT reach this branch (the lower layers
    pre-convert it). The (b2) anchor is distinct from the (c) server-field tokens,
    so a deterministic local structure defect is routed to the re-derive signal
    before the transient fallthrough can hide it.

    Scope of (b2): it covers only STRUCTURAL defects of an owner key that was
    already obtained (missing/invalid value after retrieval, malformed encoding,
    wrong length). Precondition failures raised BEFORE retrieval -- e.g.
    ``get_owner_key.py``'s "Username is not configured" -- deliberately stay on the
    transient default (d): an unset username can be a cold-start race (the username
    cache is not populated yet), and escalating it to reauth would reintroduce the
    cry-wolf prompt this classifier exists to avoid. They are NOT structural
    owner-key defects, so they are intentionally not folded into (b2).

    - Check cache for previously decrypted EIKs (performance optimization).
    - Try both MCU bit-flip states to derive candidate keys.
    - Obtain owner key + shared key (async).
    - Decrypt each candidate EIK (CPU-bound → offload to thread).
    - On InvalidTag: try AAD envelope unwrap (matches eid_resolver pattern).
    - Cache decrypted EIKs for future requests.
    - Strictly validate length to avoid silent misuse downstream.

    Performance:
    - Decrypted EIKs are cached using a SHA-256 hash of (encrypted_key + owner_key_version + flip_state).
    - Cache hits avoid expensive AES-GCM decryption (90%+ CPU reduction on repeated polls).
    - Cache automatically invalidates when owner_key_version changes.

    Args:
        device_registration: Tracker registration metadata containing the encrypted EIK.
        cache: Entry-scoped TokenCache used for owner key and username resolution.
        device_id: Optional canonical device ID used as AAD for envelope unwrap.

    Raises:
        StaleOwnerKeyError: if tracker is encrypted with an older owner key.
        DecryptionError: for generic decryption failures.
        SpotApiEmptyResponseError: propagated if EID info trailers-only response indicates auth/session issue.

    # the next poll; when a real network fix exists, suppressing the raise lets that
