# custom_components/googlefindmy/Auth/fcm_receiver_ha.py
"""Home Assistant compatible FCM receiver for Google Find My Device.

This module provides an HA-integrated Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) receiver that:
- Runs fully async with supervised background loops (one supervisor per config entry).
- Persists credentials via each entry's TokenCache (HA Store-backed).
- Notifies registered request callbacks or pushes background updates to the *right* coordinator(s).
- Avoids any synchronous cache access in the event loop.

Design notes
------------
* Lifecycle: A single shared receiver instance is managed in `hass.data[DOMAIN]`.
  Internally, this receiver manages **one FCM client per entry_id**.
* No global singletons outside this module; Home Assistant orchestrates creation/cleanup.
* The receiver never triggers UI/ChromeDriver flows; it only consumes credentials
  from caches and updates them when the server requests re-registration.
* All potentially blocking work (protobuf decoding, user callbacks) runs in executors.

Multi-account support (entry-scoped clients)
--------------------------------------------
* One client per entry: `self.pcs[entry_id]` and in-memory creds `self.creds[entry_id]`.
* One supervisor loop per entry: `self.supervisors[entry_id]` with the same
  backoff/heartbeat logic as before.
* Per-entry persistence: credentials are written to the entry's TokenCache
  (key: `fcm_credentials`); a routing set of tokens can be stored (key:
  `fcm_routing_tokens`) for resume-after-restart.
* Token → entry routing: incoming pushes are routed using the message `to` token
  (or registration endpoint token). Fallback: if no token mapping exists, all
  coordinators are considered. Optionally, an owner-index fallback can be used
  when a Home Assistant instance is attached (see `attach_hass`).

Precise fan-out (debounce with routing context)
-----------------------------------------------
* We debounce per **(entry_id, device_id)**:
    - `_pending[(entry_id, device_id)]` holds the latest decoded payload **plus** the
      routed target entry set.
    - `_schedule_flush(entry_id, device_id)` (re)starts a short timer (default 250 ms).
    - `_flush(entry_id, device_id)` fans the coalesced payload out only to coordinators
      for the routed entries (no broadcast).

Runtime telemetry (for diagnostics)
-----------------------------------
* Per-receiver metrics retained for compatibility:
  `last_start_monotonic`, `last_stop_monotonic`, `start_count` (aggregate view).
* Logs include routing details:
  `push_received(entry=<id>|unknown, device=..., fanout_targets=n, route=token|owner_index|client|fallback)`.

Retry/404 mitigation (unchanged behavior)
-----------------------------------------
* Registration keeps the existing fixes: numeric `messaging_sender_id`, `Android-GCM/1.5`
  UA in the underlying client, 404 toggle `/register ↔ /register3` (handled in client),
  bounded retries on `PHONE_REGISTRATION_ERROR`, and **no** retries on `BadAuthentication`.

# credentials callback closure is bound at client-build time and is shared
# across a fast reload (``unregister_coordinator`` bumps the generation but does
# NOT pop the reused client), so the closure alone cannot tell which supervisor
# drives the current handshake. ``_register_for_fcm_entry`` publishes its
# captured generation here for the duration of the await; the callback reads it
# and gates its writes on the *triggering* generation. A ContextVar (not a plain
# attribute) is required: many awaits inside firebase separate the publish from
# the callback, so a concurrent supervisor task must not clobber the value --
# task-local isolation does exactly that. Outside any handshake (a live-

        Defense 2 iter-10 (Codex follow-up): the latch guard is intentionally

        latch, any cap-related fatal it still protects, and the Repairs UI

        identical: re-authenticate / re-register. The fix flow in
        ``repairs.py`` calls ``entry.async_start_reauth`` on confirmation.

        The escalation thresholds are NOT re-invented here. They are the
        existing retry caps consumed at the call sites:

        * ``_MAX_FATAL_ENDPOINT_RETRIES`` (7) -- with the ``min(300, 30*n)``
          backoff this is ~630 s of sustained 404 endpoint exhaustion before
          give-up; a transient Google endpoint rotation clears well before it.
        * ``_MAX_FATAL_AUTH_RETRIES`` (3) -- 401 token-renewal exhaustion.
        * ``_BACKOFF_WARNING_THRESHOLD_S`` (64 s, ~6 failed registrations) --
          the registration backoff warning point.

        Because the repair hangs off those existing give-up/warning points, a
        transient failure (count still below the cap) never raises it. The
        recovery delete on a successful (re-)registration clears it again.

        ``reason`` is a non-localised diagnostic hint forwarded via ``data``
