# custom_components/googlefindmy/services.yaml
# Purpose: Service descriptions aligned 1:1 with integration handlers in __init__.py
# Notes:
# - We keep a REQUIRED `device_id` field so handlers have a stable input.
# - Target uses **entity filter only** (domain + integration) for HA 2025.5+.
#   Do not add `target.device` or `target.area`; entity filters are applied across UI.
# - Error strings are translated by handlers via ServiceValidationError.
# - When adding services or fields, sync the README services table so schema + docs stay aligned.
