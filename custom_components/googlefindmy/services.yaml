# custom_components/googlefindmy/services.yaml
# Purpose: Service descriptions aligned 1:1 with integration handlers in __init__.py
# Notes:
# - We keep a REQUIRED `device_id` field so handlers have a stable input.
# - A broad `target` is provided for UI convenience (device/entity/area),
#   but users must still supply `device_id` (UI enforces required).
# - Error strings are translated by handlers via ServiceValidationError.
