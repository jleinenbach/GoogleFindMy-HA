## Tests (MUST)
- ☐ `pytest -q` passes locally
- ☐ New/updated **unit/integration tests** cover the change
- ☐ For **bugfixes**: a **minimal regression test** is included that fails without the fix and passes with it
- Coverage targets:
  - ☐ `config_flow.py` remains **100%**
  - ☐ Total ≥ **95%**  
    ☐ Temporary dip due to necessary code removal — **follow-up issue** opened: #___

### Expected areas (check all that apply)
- ☐ **Config flow**: user/invalid, duplicate abort (`async_set_unique_id` + `_abort_if_unique_id_configured`), connectivity pre-check, **reauth** (success/failure → reload), **reconfigure**
- ☐ **Lifecycle**: `async_setup_entry`, **reload**, `async_unload_entry` (no zombie listeners)
- ☐ **Coordinator & availability**: `UpdateFailed` on transient errors; entities flip to `unavailable`; single “down/back” log
- ☐ **Diagnostics**: strictly redacted (no tokens/emails/locations/IDs)
- ☐ **Services**: success/error paths with localized messages; rate limiting where applicable
- ☐ **Discovery & dynamic devices** (if supported)
- ☐ **Token cache**: expiry detection, refresh, failure propagation; **no hidden fallbacks**

---

## Token Cache Safety (MUST)
- ☐ Single **entry-scoped** `TokenCache` (no globals)
- ☐ `TokenCache` is **passed explicitly** through call chains (`__init__` → API/clients → coordinator → entities)
- ☐ Refresh is **synchronous** on the calling path or fails fast with a translatable error
- ☐ On refresh failure: raises `ConfigEntryAuthFailed`
- ☐ Regression tests for stale tokens / cross-account bleed / refresh races

---

## Docs & i18n
- ☐ No hard-coded UI strings in Python
- ☐ `translations/*.json` updated (services & exceptions via `translation_key`)
- ☐ README updated (only if user-visible behavior/options changed)
- ☐ Missing files are **non-blocking**; propose stub/follow-up if needed

---

## Quality Scale (lightweight, non-blocking)
- Touched rule IDs & evidence (file+line / test name / PR link):
  - e.g. `strict-typing`: attach mypy log or CI link
  - e.g. `diagnostics`: `tests/test_diagnostics.py::test_redaction`

---

## Deprecation Check (concise)
- Versions scanned: current HA ± 2 releases
- Notes found (links): …
- Impact here: …

---

## Risk & Rollback
- Risk level: ☐ low ☐ medium ☐ high
- Rollback plan: how to revert safely if needed (and whether data/entity IDs remain consistent)

---

## Local Verification (run before pushing)
### bash:
pre-commit run --all-files
python3 -m script.hassfest
pytest -q

## Reviewer Notes (optional)

* Edge cases to double-check:
* Follow-up tasks (if any):
